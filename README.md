# Cricket_vs_Baseball
This is a deep learning trained model that attempts to distinguish between cricket and baseball players

The result will be either of:
Batsman (cricket)
Bowler (cricket)
Batter (baseball)
Pitcher (baseball)

The model was trained using image search data from Bing. However, the data was quite bad (with a lot of cartoons and unrelated images) and hence the classifier is not very good. For example, the stumps in a cricketer's image is primarily attributed to a batsman and if stumps appears in a bowler's image, it is likely to be classified as batsman.

The IPython notebook used to generate this model is not given. However, the same code (with mild exceptions) is used for the Feline Classifier repository. So please check that.
